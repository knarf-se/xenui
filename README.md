XenUI
=====
Experiments with different UI ideas and whatnot.

The core Idea of this project is to create a UI framework that makes desktop interfaces take a leap in terms UI usability and standards. Some ideas are purely experimental, like the ability to just pop a window over to another device without user code ever noticing any differnce.

__Status__: Currently quite unusable :) Check back later!
Patches are **always** welcome.

Build & Configuration
---------------------
If you already got [Premake][Pmak], you just have to do `premake4 gmake && make` in the root directory of the project. If not, go and grab yourself a copy of [Premake4][Pmak]!

Premake can also generate projectfiles for different IDEs, but I do not use them so I do not know if it works.
